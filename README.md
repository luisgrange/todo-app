# todo-app 📝
Simple todo list app

Well, well, here we go with python again 😂
I feel lazy these days, so I decided build something to help me<br>
I wish I knew how turn it in a real application but... I don't!

### What this app can do?
It's a todo app, so you can:

+ Write your tasks
+ Select which ones you did
+ Delete
+ Save
+ Open

This time I used <i>TKinter</i> <s>because I don't know if I can do it with turtle</s>
So I tried do it as simple as I could, still ugly? yes, of course, but I can handle that later
